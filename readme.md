## Study Information
This study is about the CO2 emission by the cars sold in France in 2015.  
The study is split in several parts.

## Statistical Study
The statistical study is the original project which has served as basis of the shiny application. This study analyzes the different model of cars sold in France in 2015 and extract a prediction model based on this dataset. 
The information about this study are available in this repository in the Study directory. The final report is named "FinalReport" and it is provided either in Rmd, pdf and html format.  
The code used in this report is also in the study directory in a file named "Code for the study.R".  
And finally a very brief description of the study is given in the prompt file which is also provided in Rmd, pdf and html format.

## Shiny Application
The model was used in a shiny application publicly available at https://flaforgia.shinyapps.io/ShinyCode.  
The code for this app is provided in this repository in the directory "ShinyCode".
The ShinyCode directory contains also the dataset used for the analysis. This is the file "fic_etiq_edition_40-mars-2015.csv".  
A short presentation (5 pages) of the application is located on http://flaforgia.github.io.
